Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With a small number of simulations, teams with lower ratings like Denmark are predicted to have a fairly high chance of winning.
As the number of simulations is increased, these predictions are proved incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
The result seems to be stabilized beyond 1000 simulations.
This means that further increasing the number of simulations over 1000 is unnecessary or not optimal.
Thus, I would call the predictions from 1000 simulations "good enough".
